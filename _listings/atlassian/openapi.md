        piece of content \nhas different types of child content, depending on its
        type. These are \nthe default parent-child content type relationships:\n\n-

        content is `comment`, `attachment`\n- `attachment`: child content is `comment`\n-
        `comment`: child content is `attachment`\n\nApps can override these default
        relationships. Apps can also introduce \nnew content types that create new
        parent-child content relationships.\n\nNote, the map will always include all
        child content types that are valid \nfor the content. However, if the content
        has no instances of a child content \ntype, the map will contain an empty
        array for that child content type.\n\n**[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/_AozKw)
