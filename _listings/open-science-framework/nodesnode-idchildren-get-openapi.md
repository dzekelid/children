  title: Open Science Framework List all child nodes
  description: |-
    A paginated list of the next level child nodes for the given node. The returned nodes are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated child nodes appearing first.

    The list will include child nodes that are public, as well as child nodes that are private, if the authenticated user has permission to view them.
    #### Returns
    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

    The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 child nodes. If the given node has zero child nodes, the `data` key will contain an empty array. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the child node, meaning additional requests to the child node's detail view are not necessary.

    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

    This request should never return an error.
    #### Filtering
    You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/children/?filter[title]=reproducibility.

    Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `preprint`, and `contributors`.

    Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.
