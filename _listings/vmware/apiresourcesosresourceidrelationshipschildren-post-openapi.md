  title: VMWare vRealize Operations Add Child Resource to a Resource
  description: "This operation adds a child resource to a resource.  \n\nAPI documentation
    states that POST is additive while PUT is destructive (i.e. overwites existing
    relationships).\n\nJSON body includes an array of child objects to add.  \n\nThe
    call does not provide a lot of detail for failure, but it seems\nthat if you have
    an invalid UUID for a child or the child is already related\nthen it will fail
    with 400.\n\n204 is a successful call."
